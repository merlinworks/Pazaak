## Pazaak
---
#### An implementation of the gambling game in Star Wars "Pazaak"
## Objective:
When the game ends the player that has the score closest too (without going above) 20 wins. The game ends when a player has reached a score of 20 or all players have a score above 20 are stand.
## Turns:
1. At the start of a turn the player (automatically) draws a card from the main deck and the card's value is added to their score.
2. After the value is added to their score the player has an option to play a card from their hand, this card can add or subtract to their original score depending on the value of the card.
3. After the player has the choice to play a card the player chooses to continue or to "stand", standing will result in their score staying the same until the end of the game, at which time their score will be counted.
Please submit an issue if there is something missing!
